<p>Marketing Major, Pursuing Masters of Information Systems</p>
<img src="Elayna.jpg" alt="a picture of Elayna">
<p>I chose to study Marketing and Information Systems because I wanted to use my creative and analytical skills together. Marketing was an obvious choice for me as I grew up creating art and always having an eye for the aesthtics, story telling, and creating something new. With this side of me, also came a natural talent for solving problems, and analyzing data. I wanted to find something that I could utilize both sides of my skills and Information Systems intriqued me. I hope to leave this program with a better understanding of the changing world around me and the ability to execute any creative solution I think of.</p>
